"""
Module nflfan provides a way to connect your fantasy rosters with
statistical data in nfldb in order to perform live scoring. nflfan also
provides a simple web interface that can be used to watch all of your
fantasy games with real time updates. The web server can be started by
running:

    #!bash
    python -m nflfan.web

Currently, only Yahoo and ESPN fantasy leagues are supported. But
nflfan is extensible, and it will be easy to add more leagues in the
future.

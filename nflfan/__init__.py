Module nfldb provides command line tools and a library for maintaining
and querying a relational database of play-by-play NFL data. The data
is imported from [nflgame](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame),
which in turn gets its data from a JSON feed on NFL.com's live
GameCenter pages. This data includes, but is not limited to, game
schedules, scores, rosters and play-by-play data for every preseason,
regular season and postseason game dating back to 2009.

Here is a small teaser that shows how to use nfldb to find the top five
passers in the 2012 regular season:

    #!python
    import nfldb

    db = nfldb.connect()
    q = nfldb.Query(db)

    q.game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')
    for pp in q.sort('passing_yds').limit(5).as_aggregate():
        print pp.player, pp.passing_yds

And the output is:

    [andrew@Liger ~] python2 top-five.py
    Drew Brees (NO, QB) 5177
    Matthew Stafford (DET, QB) 4965
    Tony Romo (DAL, QB) 4903
    Tom Brady (NE, QB) 4799
    Matt Ryan (ATL, QB) 4719

In theory, both `nfldb` and `nflgame` provide access to the same data.
The difference is in the execution. In order to search data in nflgame,
a large JSON file needs to be read from disk and loaded into Python
data structures for each game. Conversely, nfldb's data is stored in
a relational database, which can be searched and retrieved faster
than nflgame by a few orders of magnitude. Moreover, the relational
organization of data in nfldb allows for a convenient
[query interface](http://goo.gl/Sd6MN2) to search NFL play data.

The database can be updated with real time data from active games by
running the `nfldb-update` script included with this module as often
as you're comfortable pinging NFL.com. (N.B. The JSON data itself only
updates every 15 seconds, so running `nfldb-update` faster than that
would be wasteful.) Roster updates are done automatically at a minimum
interval of 12 hours.

nfldb has [comprehensive API documentation](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb)
and a [wiki with examples](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki).

nfldb can be used in conjunction with
[nflvid](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nflvid)
to
[search and watch NFL game footage](http://goo.gl/Mckaf0).
